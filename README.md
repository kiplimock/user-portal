## User Management System

This a simple flask application that performs basic CRUD operations on database.
A user registers on the register page and the details are added to the database.
The users page allows anyone **(logged in or not)** to view all users registered in the app.
To edit your details, you have to be logged in. If you signed up as an admin, you have the provilege of editing other users' information.

*I have deployed this application to heroku. Check it out on:* https://user-crud-manager.herokuapp.com/
